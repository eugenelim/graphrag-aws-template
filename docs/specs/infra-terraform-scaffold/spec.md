# Spec: infra-terraform-scaffold

- **Status:** Shipped <!-- Draft | Approved | Implementing | Shipped | Archived -->
- **Owner:** eugenelim
- **Plan:** [`plan.md`](plan.md)
- **Constrained by:** [ADR-0010](../../adr/0010-terraform-migration.md) (migrate IaC from CDK to Terraform — this spec ships the first slice of that decision); [ADR-0002](../../adr/0002-ephemeral-vpc-store-topology.md) (the ephemeral VPC topology; teardown is a feature); generate-iac skill (`SKILL.md`) — the governing IaC authoring skill
- **Shape:** data (infrastructure scaffolding; no application logic)

> **Spec contract:** this document defines what "done" means for the Terraform
> scaffold tier. The implementing PR must match this spec, or update it.
> Verification must be derivable from it.

> **Terraform scaffold** for the GraphRAG AWS demo — provider config, backend,
> variable definitions, and an outputs shell — that forms the foundation every
> subsequent Terraform spec builds on. ADR-0010 records the decision to migrate;
> this spec ships the first artifact of that decision: a valid, `terraform
> validate`-clean root module under `apps/infra-tf/`.

## Objective

Establish the Terraform root module skeleton for `apps/infra-tf/` so that every
subsequent implementation spec (network, data + IAM, compute, verification) has a
clean, versioned, reproducible foundation to build on. The deliverables are seven
files: `versions.tf`, `provider.tf`, `backend.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`,
`backend.hcl.example`, and `scripts/bootstrap.sh`. ADR-0010 is authored alongside
(it records the decision; the scaffold is the first tangible implementation artifact
of that decision).

The scaffold is **deploy-ready at the foundation tier**: `terraform init -backend=false` and
`terraform validate` pass on a clean checkout with no resources defined yet;
`terraform fmt -check` exits 0; all required variable names match the CDK
`CfnParameter` names (mapping documented in the plan).

## Boundaries

### Always do

- **Use Terraform ≥ 1.11 and AWS provider ~> 5.0.** Native S3 state locking (GA in
  1.11) removes the DynamoDB table bootstrap; no `dynamodb_table` in the backend
  block. Pin the exact provider version in `versions.tf`.
- **Translate every CDK `CfnParameter` to a Terraform variable.** Three parameters
  map to required variables (no default, must be supplied): `budget_alarm_email`
  (string), `invoker_role_arn` (string), `s3_prefix_list_id` (string, validated by
  regex `^pl-[0-9a-f]+$`). The regex on `s3_prefix_list_id` is load-bearing (mirrors
  the CDK `AllowedPattern`; rejects a CIDR or free-form value at plan time).
  **Superseded (2026-07-22):** `s3_prefix_list_id` was removed by
  [`infra-terraform-network`](../infra-terraform-network/spec.md) (SEC-2 hardening) —
  the AWS-managed S3 prefix list is now resolved via
  `data "aws_ec2_managed_prefix_list" "s3"`, so there is no operator-supplied
  prefix-list id to validate. Two required variables remain.
- **Declare all five governance tag variables with defaults matching
  `_GOVERNANCE_TAG_DEFAULTS`.** `environment = "demo"`, `project =
  "graphrag-aws-template"`, `department = "unspecified"`, `application =
  "graphrag"`, `user = "unspecified"`. Apply via `default_tags` in `provider.tf`
  so every resource inherits them without per-resource `tags = {}` blocks.
- **S3 backend with native state locking.** Backend block configures `bucket`,
  `key`, `region`, `encrypt = true`. Supply a companion `backend.hcl.example`
  with placeholder values so the first-time bootstrap is documented.
- **`outputs.tf` shell.** Declare all 12 output names matching the CDK
  `CfnOutput` names (`CorpusBucketName`, `NeptuneEndpoint`, `EcsClusterName`,
  `IngestionTaskDefArn`, `IngestionSecurityGroupId`, `PrivateSubnetId`,
  `IngestionRepoUri`, `SmokeProbeName`, `OpenSearchEndpoint`,
  `VectorSmokeProbeName`, `QueryFunctionUrl`, `QueryLambdaName`) with placeholder
  `value = null` bodies; filled in by subsequent specs.
- **`terraform fmt -check` must pass** — HCL formatting is non-negotiable.

### Ask first

- Changing `required_version` below 1.11 (removes native state locking).
- Adding a second cloud provider (not in scope for this repo; ADR-0002 is AWS-only).
- Changing the backend type away from S3 (changes the bootstrap procedure).

### Never do

- **Never emit `terraform apply` or `terraform destroy`** — this skill's deliverable
  stops at a clean `plan` (generate-iac SKILL.md hard rule).
- **Never commit `*.tfvars` with real values** — `backend.hcl.example` is the only
  tfvars-shaped file and carries only placeholder values.
- **Never use DynamoDB state locking** — superseded by native S3 locking in
  Terraform ≥ 1.11 (generate-iac skill anti-pattern).
- **Never hardcode region or account ID** — both are inputs (region via the provider
  `region` variable; account implicit from the caller's credentials).
- **Never delete or modify `apps/infra/`** — the CDK app stays in place until all
  Terraform specs pass their live ACs (ADR-0010); it is the fallback and the
  comparison reference.
- **Never promote `apps/infra-tf/` to a top-level directory** — it is a sub-app
  under `apps/`, parallel to `apps/infra/`; a top-level move requires an RFC
  (AGENTS.md structure policy).

## Testing Strategy

All ACs in this spec are **goal-based check** mode — the validation artifact is a
successful CLI invocation, not a unit test file.

- **AC1–AC6 and AC4b — goal-based.** Each file's structure is verified by `terraform
  validate` (schema correctness) and `terraform fmt -check` (formatting). AC4b
  verifies plan-time variable rejection via a local-backend override: `terraform plan`
  with an invalid `invoker_role_arn` (root principal) exits 1; with valid values exits
  0. *(The `s3_prefix_list_id` (CIDR) rejection this originally also verified was
  superseded 2026-07-22 by `infra-terraform-network` SEC-2 — variable removed.)*
- **AC7 — goal-based.** `terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate` exits 0;
  `terraform fmt -check` exits 0. The backend bootstrap script is a deliverable, not a
  test — it is documented and manually verified on the first live deploy.

Gates: `terraform fmt -check`, `terraform validate` (run from `apps/infra-tf/`
after `terraform init -backend=false`).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC1 — `versions.tf`: pinned Terraform + provider versions.** *(goal-based
  check)* `required_version = ">= 1.11, < 2.0"` and `required_providers { aws = { source =
  "hashicorp/aws", version = "~> 5.0" } }` are present. No other provider is
  declared.

- [x] **AC2 — `provider.tf`: AWS provider with default governance tags.** *(goal-based
  check)* The `provider "aws" {}` block configures `default_tags { tags = { ... } }`
  using the five governance tag variables (`var.environment`, `var.project`,
  `var.department`, `var.application`, `var.user`) matching the CDK
  `_GOVERNANCE_TAG_DEFAULTS` keys and defaults. Region is `var.aws_region`.

- [x] **AC3 — `backend.tf`: S3 backend with native state locking, no DynamoDB.** *(goal-based
  check)* The `terraform { backend "s3" { ... } }` block is present with `encrypt =
  true`, `use_lockfile = true` (explicit opt-in required for native S3 locking in
  Terraform >= 1.11), and no `dynamodb_table` key. A companion `backend.hcl.example`
  documents the bootstrap values (`bucket`, `key`, `region`) with placeholder strings.

- [x] **AC4 — `variables.tf`: all required + governance variables with correct types and
  validation.** *(goal-based check)* Required variables: `budget_alarm_email` (string,
  no default, description matches CDK parameter), `invoker_role_arn` (string, no
  default, validation rejecting non-role ARNs). Governance variables: `environment`,
  `project`, `department`, `application`, `user`, `aws_region` — all string with
  defaults matching `_GOVERNANCE_TAG_DEFAULTS`. The validation block is present and
  structurally correct (`terraform validate` exits 0).
  *(Superseded 2026-07-22 by `infra-terraform-network` SEC-2: the third required
  variable `s3_prefix_list_id` (string, `^pl-[0-9a-f]+$` validation) that this AC
  originally asserted was removed — the S3 managed prefix list is now resolved via
  `data "aws_ec2_managed_prefix_list" "s3"`, so there is no operator-supplied id to
  declare or validate.)*

- [x] **AC4b — plan-time validation rejection verified.** `terraform plan` (local backend
  override) with `invoker_role_arn=...:root` exits 1 with a role-ARN error; with valid
  values exits 0 with "No changes."
  *(Superseded 2026-07-22 by `infra-terraform-network` SEC-2: the `s3_prefix_list_id=0.0.0.0/0`
  regex-mismatch rejection this AC originally verified no longer applies — the variable
  was removed; the S3 prefix list is now resolved from the account, not supplied.)*

- [x] **AC5 — `outputs.tf`: shell output blocks for all 12 CDK CfnOutput names.** *(goal-based
  check)* All 12 output names from the CDK stack are declared: `corpus_bucket_name`,
  `neptune_endpoint`, `ecs_cluster_name`, `ingestion_task_def_arn`,
  `ingestion_security_group_id`, `private_subnet_id`, `ingestion_repo_uri`,
  `smoke_probe_name`, `opensearch_endpoint`, `vector_smoke_probe_name`,
  `query_function_url`, `query_lambda_name`. Each stub body is `value = null` —
  subsequent specs replace the null with the actual resource attribute reference.
  Note: `OpenSearchEndpoint` → `opensearch_endpoint` (OpenSearch is one token).

- [x] **AC6 — `terraform fmt -check` exits 0 across all scaffold files.** *(goal-based
  check)* No formatting violations on any `.tf` file in `apps/infra-tf/`.

- [x] **AC7 — `terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate` exits 0 from `apps/infra-tf/`.** *(goal-based
  check)* With the backend skipped (`-backend=false`) and the five required variables
  supplied, `terraform validate` exits 0 and reports "Success! The configuration is
  valid."

## Assumptions

- Technical: Terraform CLI ≥ 1.11 is available in the deploy environment; the AWS
  provider hashicorp/aws ~> 5.0 is the target (source: generate-iac SKILL.md;
  ADR-0010).
- Technical: native S3 state locking (no DynamoDB) is available in Terraform ≥ 1.11
  (source: Terraform 1.11 release notes; generate-iac skill anti-patterns section).
- Technical: the S3 backend bucket is pre-provisioned (out of scope for this spec;
  documented in `bootstrap.sh`); the backend.hcl.example documents the values
  needed (source: generate-iac skill bootstrap-sequence reference).
- Technical: the `apps/infra-tf/` directory is created alongside `apps/infra/` (the
  CDK app), not replacing it; CDK is archived after all Terraform specs pass their
  live ACs (source: ADR-0010 decision text).
- Technical: the five governance tag variable names are lowercase
  (`environment`, `project`, `department`, `application`, `user`) matching the CDK
  `_GOVERNANCE_TAG_DEFAULTS` keys lowercased (source:
  `apps/infra/stacks/graphrag_stack.py` `_GOVERNANCE_TAG_DEFAULTS`).
- Process: this spec ships in full mode (new dependency on Terraform, structural
  change, governance boundary); ADR-0010 is the governance record (source:
  CONVENTIONS.md risk triggers).

## Changelog

- 2026-07-22 — Spec authored. Terraform scaffold tier for the CDK→Terraform migration
  (ADR-0010): versions.tf, provider.tf, backend.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf shell.
  Goal-based ACs; validation by `terraform init && validate && fmt -check`. Five
  subsequent specs build on this foundation.
- 2026-07-22 — `s3_prefix_list_id` variable + its `^pl-[0-9a-f]+$` validation AC
  superseded by `infra-terraform-network` (SEC-2 hardening): the AWS-managed S3 prefix
  list is now resolved via `data "aws_ec2_managed_prefix_list" "s3"` rather than an
  operator-supplied var. Two required variables remain (`budget_alarm_email`,
  `invoker_role_arn`).
